*Date: May 22, 2025*

This document outlines a structured Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) approach for addressing issues in the 3WayCoT framework core components.

## 1. PLAN: Issue Identification and Strategy

### 1.1 Current State Assessment

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ F-string syntax error in `cot_generator.py`

## 2. DO: Implementation Strategy

### 2.1 Component-Specific Approaches

**Chain of Thought Generator:**
```python
# Confidence extraction enhancement example
def extract_confidence(step_text):
    # Regular expression patterns for different confidence formats
    patterns = [
        r'confidence:?\s*(\d+\.?\d*)',  # Confidence: 0.85
        r'confidence\s*level:?\s*(\d+\.?\d*)',  # Confidence level: 0.85
        r'with\s*(\d+\.?\d*)\s*confidence',  # with 0.85 confidence
        # Add more patterns as needed
    ]
    
    # Try each pattern
    for pattern in patterns:
        match = re.search(pattern, step_text, re.IGNORECASE)
        if match:
            confidence = float(match.group(1))
            # Validate confidence is in [0,1]
            return max(0.0, min(1.0, confidence))
    
    # Default confidence with logging
    logging.warning(f"No confidence value found in step: {step_text[:50]}...")
    return 0.7  # Default aligns with framework specifications
```

**Three-Way Decision Maker:**
```python
# Proper membership degree calculation example
def calculate_membership_degrees(step, confidence, metrics):
    # Calculate membership degrees based on confidence and other metrics
    accept_degree = 0.6 * confidence + 0.2 * metrics.get('similarity', 0.5) + 0.2 * metrics.get('stability', 0.5)
    reject_degree = 0.6 * (1.0 - confidence) + 0.2 * metrics.get('uncertainty', 0.5) + 0.2 * (1.0 - metrics.get('coverage', 0.5))
    
    # Calculate abstain degree - higher when confidence is around 0.5 (most uncertain)
    abstain_degree = 0.6 * (1.0 - abs(confidence - 0.5) * 2) + 0.4 * metrics.get('uncertainty', 0.5)
    
    # Normalize to ensure sum equals 1.0
    total = accept_degree + reject_degree + abstain_degree
    return {
        'accept': accept_degree / total,
        'reject': reject_degree / total,
        'abstain': abstain_degree / total
    }
```

### 2.2 Testing Strategy

For each component:
1. Create isolated unit tests focusing on specific functionality
2. Develop integration tests for interactions between components
3. Create end-to-end tests with representative examples from datasets

**Example Test for Decision Maker:**
```python
def test_decision_maker_confidence_thresholds():
    # Create a decision maker with specific thresholds
    decision_maker = ThreeWayDecisionMaker(alpha=0.7, beta=0.6, gamma=0.5)
    
    # Test high confidence cases (should be ACCEPT)
    high_conf_step = {'step_num': 1, 'confidence': 0.85, 'reasoning': 'Test reasoning'}
    decision = decision_maker.decide_step(high_conf_step, {}, {}, 0)
    assert decision['decision'] == 'ACCEPT'
    
    # Test low confidence cases (should be REJECT)
    low_conf_step = {'step_num': 2, 'confidence': 0.3, 'reasoning': 'Test reasoning'}
    decision = decision_maker.decide_step(low_conf_step, {}, {}, 1)
    assert decision['decision'] == 'REJECT'
    
    # Test boundary cases (should be ABSTAIN)
    mid_conf_step = {'step_num': 3, 'confidence': 0.65, 'reasoning': 'Test reasoning'}
    decision = decision_maker.decide_step(mid_conf_step, {}, {}, 2)
    assert decision['decision'] == 'ABSTAIN'
```

## 3. CHECK: Validation and Measurement
