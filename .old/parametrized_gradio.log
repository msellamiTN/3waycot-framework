2025-05-25 23:35:50,179 - 3WayCoT.COTGenerator - INFO - EXITING construct_prompt You are an expert problem solver. Your task is to analyze the following problem through careful, step-by-step reasoning.

IMPORTANT: For each step, you MUST list EXACTLY 5 key assumptions. NEVER exceed 5 assumptions per step. If you have more assumptions, prioritize the most critical ones. Each assumption should be concise and clearly stated.

Format your response following these instructions:
- 1. 1. Break down your reasoning into clear, numbered steps.
- 2. 2. CRITICAL: After EACH step, you MUST provide a structured confidence block with the following format:
   confidence: [value between 0.0-1.0]
   method: [how you determined this confidence - e.g., 'prior knowledge', 'statistical analysis', 'expert judgment', etc.]
- 3. 3. The confidence value MUST be a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is no confidence and 1.0 is absolute certainty.
- 4. 4. After the confidence block, list your assumptions using 'Assumptions:' followed by a numbered list.
- 5. 5. Be explicit about uncertainties or limitations in your 'method' description.
- 6. 6. Conclude with a final answer that includes a structured confidence block in the same format.
- 7. 7. CRITICAL: You MUST list EXACTLY 5 assumptions per step. This is a HARD LIMIT. If you have more, prioritize the top 5.

- 2. 2. CRITICAL: After EACH step, you MUST provide a structured confidence block with the following format:
   confidence: [value between 0.0-1.0]
   method: [how you determined this confidence - e.g., 'prior knowledge', 'statistical analysis', 'expert judgment', etc.]
- 3. 3. The confidence value MUST be a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is no confidence and 1.0 is absolute certainty.
- 4. 4. After the confidence block, list your assumptions using 'Assumptions:' followed by a numbered list.
- 5. 5. Be explicit about uncertainties or limitations in your 'method' description.
- 6. 6. Conclude with a final answer that includes a structured confidence block in the same format.
- 7. 7. CRITICAL: You MUST list EXACTLY 5 assumptions per step. This is a HARD LIMIT. If you have more, prioritize the top 5.

2025-05-25 23:58:11,416 - 3WayCoT.COTGenerator - INFO - EXITING construct_prompt You are an expert problem solver. Your task is to analyze the following problem through careful, step-by-step reasoning.

IMPORTANT: For each step, you MUST list EXACTLY 5 key assumptions. NEVER exceed 5 assumptions per step. If you have more assumptions, prioritize the most critical ones. Each assumption should be concise and clearly stated.

Format your response following these instructions:
- 1. 1. Break down your reasoning into clear, numbered steps.
- 2. 2. CRITICAL: After EACH step, you MUST provide a structured confidence block with the following format:
   confidence: [value between 0.0-1.0]
   method: [how you determined this confidence - e.g., 'prior knowledge', 'statistical analysis', 'expert judgment', etc.]
- 3. 3. The confidence value MUST be a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is no confidence and 1.0 is absolute certainty.
- 4. 4. After the confidence block, list your assumptions using 'Assumptions:' followed by a numbered list.
- 5. 5. Be explicit about uncertainties or limitations in your 'method' description.
- 6. 6. Conclude with a final answer that includes a structured confidence block in the same format.
- 7. 7. CRITICAL: You MUST list EXACTLY 5 assumptions per step. This is a HARD LIMIT. If you have more, prioritize the top 5.

2025-05-25 23:58:11,424 - 3WayCoT.COTGenerator - INFO - With query_llm You are an expert problem solver. Your task is to analyze the following problem through careful, step-by-step reasoning.

IMPORTANT: For each step, you MUST list EXACTLY 5 key assumptions. NEVER exceed 5 assumptions per step. If you have more assumptions, prioritize the most critical ones. Each assumption should be concise and clearly stated.

Format your response following these instructions:
- 1. 1. Break down your reasoning into clear, numbered steps.
- 2. 2. CRITICAL: After EACH step, you MUST provide a structured confidence block with the following format:
   confidence: [value between 0.0-1.0]
   method: [how you determined this confidence - e.g., 'prior knowledge', 'statistical analysis', 'expert judgment', etc.]
- 3. 3. The confidence value MUST be a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is no confidence and 1.0 is absolute certainty.
- 4. 4. After the confidence block, list your assumptions using 'Assumptions:' followed by a numbered list.
- 5. 5. Be explicit about uncertainties or limitations in your 'method' description.
- 6. 6. Conclude with a final answer that includes a structured confidence block in the same format.
- 7. 7. CRITICAL: You MUST list EXACTLY 5 assumptions per step. This is a HARD LIMIT. If you have more, prioritize the top 5.


Query: A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show:\nPlatelet count 14,200/mm3\nFibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL)\nD-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL)\nWhen phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?\"", "answer": "Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar", "options": {"A": "Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar", "B": "Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar", "C": "Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar", "D": "Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar", "E": "Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar"}, "meta_info": "step1", "answer_idx": "D"}
