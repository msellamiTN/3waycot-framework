- [ ] Add parameters: provider-list, max_assumptions, temperature, etc.
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests

### 2. Triadic Fuzzy Formal Context Generation
- [ ] Create TriadicContext class
- [ ] Implement similarity-based inclusion operators
- [ ] Add support for multiple similarity metrics
- [ ] Implement context validation
- [ ] Add serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration with CoT generator

### 3. Lattice Construction
- [ ] Implement lattice node and edge structures
- [ ] Add lattice construction algorithm
- [ ] Implement visualization (optional)
- [ ] Add lattice analysis methods
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration with TriadicContext

### 4. Uncertainty Resolution
- [ ] Implement uncertainty metrics
- [ ] Add resolution strategies
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring
- [ ] Add conflict resolution

### Next Steps for CoT Generator:
1. **Real Provider Integration**
   - [ ] Implement Gemini provider integration
   - [ ] Add support for OpenAI's latest models
   - [ ] Add support for Anthropic Claude models
   - [ ] Implement proper async handling for all providers
   - [ ] Add rate limiting and retry mechanisms

2. **Integration with Model Classes**
   - [ ] Connect CoT Generator with Inverted TFCA

   - [ ] Create comparison benchmarks between models
- [ ] Phase 1.2: Triadic Fuzzy Formal Context Generation (0%)
- [ ] Phase 1.3: Lattice Construction (0%)
- [ ] Phase 1.4: Uncertainty Resolution (0%)
- [ ] Phase 1.5: Decision Making (0%)
- [ ] Phase 2: Integration and Optimization (0%)
- [ ] Phase 3: Deployment (0%)

## Notes
- Each component should be fully tested before moving to the next
- Document all public APIs
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Add type hints for better maintainability
